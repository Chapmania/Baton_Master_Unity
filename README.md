## Overview 

Baton Master is an educational Virtual Reality experience built for the Oculus platform. It allows a player to conduct an orchestra in a simulated environment. This is a project built using Unity, and the implementation files are in C#. Right now, the game is built around 1 song: "Finish the Fight" by Michael Salvatorri, aka the Halo 3 theme (because Halo 3 will always be my favorite Halo game, sorry kids). But more songs can easily be added once you understand the project structure and game mechanics.
